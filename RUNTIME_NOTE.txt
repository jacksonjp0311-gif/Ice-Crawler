RUNTIME NOTE (ICE-CRAWLER v5.0C)

PowerShell path truth (from repo root):
  ✅ .\IceCrawler.exe
  ✅ .\dist\IceCrawler.exe

Do NOT run (from arbitrary folder):
  ❌ dist\IceCrawler.exe
PowerShell can interpret 'dist' as a module name.

Bug-class fixed in v5.0C:
  Frozen runtime previously wrote into _MEIPASS temp space.
  Now it anchors to EXE folder (stable public behavior).
