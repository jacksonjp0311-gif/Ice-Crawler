# CODEX–777 Triadic Boundary Excess Principle (v2.0)

Author: James Paul Jackson  
Date: February 4, 2026

## Scope

This note captures a **boundary-selected geometric threshold** used as an inspiration model for triadic balancing in ICE-CRAWLER.

- `{3,6}` represents flat closure in equilateral triangular tiling.
- `{3,7}` is the first hyperbolic excess step.
- Minimal excess integer: `k* = 7`.
- Triadic replication under `C3` symmetry yields `(7,7,7)`.

## Engineering interpretation in this repository

The principle is mapped as a **selection and balancing heuristic**, not a math theorem implementation:

- Preserve triadic separation of concerns.
- Favor minimal bounded excess instead of unbounded expansion.
- Maintain deterministic, auditable output under strict constraints.

## Non-goals

- No numerological interpretation.
- No claim of universal applicability across all lattices.
- No replacement for security validation and testing.
